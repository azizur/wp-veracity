WP-Veracity v1.0
=================

WP-Veracity rates your Wordpress posts by applying bayesian algorithms to post popularity and influence.

WP-Veracity helps surface the more recent and interesting content on your blog, rather than simply the most popular post.  This plug-in is a mashup of Popularity Contest from Crowd Favorite (http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/plugins/popularity-contest/) and Bayesian Top Title Learner (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bayesian-top-title-learner/).
